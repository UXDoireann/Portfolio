                  <div class="full_text">
                     <p>Open water swimming is a sport that has seen a 'rising tide' of popularity in Ireland in recent times.
                        Even before the pandemic, the health benefits - both mental and physical - along with the camaraderie and love for the water
                        had increased the numbers of enthusiasts taking the plunge. Lockdown restrictions saw an accelerated wave of new swimmers, with news of 
                        the sport's new found favour even making waves <a class="swim_link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/25/shivering-dublin-bay-swimmers-slighted-for-fancy-robes">offshore.</a>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                             However, for swimmers looking to find out important information before a swim eg. tide times, sea conditions, water temperature and more -
                             it can be difficult. Tide and sea apps are mostly aimed at other 'sea-activities' eg. sailing, surfing or fishing. 
                             I wanted to design an app just for open water swimmers to help them find the information they needed before a swim, to help them
                             getting the best of of their swim, while staying safe.

                        UX Research has been completed on this project - including an online survey, usability tests and competitive benchmarking.
                        Research has also been analyized using an affinity diagram and results can be seen on a customer journey map. 
                       <br> Design is currently in progress.
