               <p id="about" style="font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif">I'm a Visual Artist turned UX/UI Designer with Front-End Development Skills </p>
                 <p id="abouttext" style="font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif">After over 10 years of exhibiting sculpture both nationally and internationally, the global pandemic exposed the long-term precarious nature of this career path and I knew it was time to change tack. Design has always been something of interest to me. While initially my â€˜drawâ€™ to UX & UI design was due to a pragmatism to acquire an â€˜in-demandâ€™ skill, it soon became apparent that this is a natural fit for my unique skill set. 
<br><br><br>
                 Visual skills are really second nature to me and I have an impressive track record to demonstrate this. My sculpture work can be viewed <a href="http://www.cargocollective.com/doireann" style="opacity:1;color:#e91e63;font-size:25px; margin-left: 0px;">here</a>. To support my career as an artist, Iâ€™ve also worked in a number of public-facing roles â€“ most recently as a tour guide in Dublin Castle and Government Buildings.  Being the front face of such organisations requires an ability to tune in and listen to the needs and expectations of a diverse range of people from all over the world, at the same time presenting the complex story of Irish history in an engaging and entertaining manner. 
               <br><br>  <br> 
                  Over the years, working as an artist, I kept learning new techniques and skills â€“ from plaster-casting to 3D-printing â€“ to constantly innovate â€“ because to know the possibilities (or limits!) of what can be done, itâ€™s integral to have a knowledge of the process. For this reason, I decided to also learn how to code. While studying for my Professional Diploma in UX, I also completed a Nanodegree in Front-End Development from Udacity. I love coding and was delighted to be able to code this entire portfolio website from scratch ðŸ˜Š 
                 <br><br> <br>
                
                 Creativity and communication are at the heart of everything I do. Whether itâ€™s putting on an exhibition of contemporary sculpture, explaining the Anglo-Irish Treaty to tourists, designing a flight-booking app or coding a portfolio website, presenting complex information, ideas and stories in a clear but engaging manner to a diverse audience is my superpower.  </p>
