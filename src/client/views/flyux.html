                  involved designing a mobile flight-booking app for a fictitious airline.
                  From user research, to analysis, to design, prototyping and wireframing, I gained
                  experience of the full life cycle of a UX project. Scroll down to see the process or click the link to see the finished prototype.</p>

         <p>To understand how best-in-class mobile apps solve the problem of creating 
            a positive user experience of booking flights, I compared and reviewed four apps.
            I chose three well-regarded airline apps along with an accommodation booking app to see
            how a more indirect competitor designs for booking experiences.
            This proved to be an invaluable document that I referred back to on numerous occasions throughout
            the research, analysis and design phases.<br><br>

            <ul>
               <li>If the last time they booked a flight, did they use a mobile app or desktop website?</li>
               <li>Did they use an aggregator website as part of their search?</li>
               <li>What website or mobile app did they use to make their booking and why?</li>
               <li>Did this mobile app or website allow them to complete their booking easily?</li>

         <p>I conducted three usability tests, each including an in-depth interview examining the user's habits
            and contexts surrounding their previous experiences of booking flights online. As FlyUX is a fictitious
            airline, I used two apps previously reviewed during Competitive Benchmarking: Turkish Airlines and Easyjet.<br><br>
            Listening to and observing these people search for and book flights was an incredibly interesting
            experience and provided a trove of insights and ideas. Throughout the overall design process, I kept
            these people in mind, thinking of their goals, their behaviours, their frustrations, their delight,
            their skepticism, their surprise and their stories.

         <p>Having collected a great deal of qualitative research, the next step was to use an affinity diagram to analyse the data in-depth. Sharing my research with another person, collaboratively, we wrote our observations on post-its. Following this a process of organising and re-organising the post-its ensued. As there was a lot to analyze, we got really granular in our final groupings of data. 
            While there is a lot to digest here, there were some key points that struck me....

            <li>A general distrust and skepticism of 'extras' and luggage costs and hence a need for a constant <b>price clarity</b></li>

            <p>A protoype isn't a prototype without a user to test it. Upon completing a medium-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD, I undertook a usability test, exploiting the opportunity to also conduct another indepth interview.
               Overall, the user found the prototype very easy to use, with a good general flow. I took note of some minor improvements that could be made during the 
               next iteration to further improve the flow. I was thinking little details eg. chevrons that animate to crosses when sections are opened and closed - which might sound trivial, but those visual cues really help people intuitively understand what's happening.

          Everything was working as expected and the user found it easy to use. Small visual nudges using animations and images further enhanced the flow. Please see image of screens below or click on the link to try the prototype yourself.

         <p>Flight booking can be a anxiety inducing experience for many people. Being forthcoming with key information throughout the process is really
            important in gaining trust with the person using the app. Throughout the design process, I constantly thought back to the usability tests. 
            Design descisions all have their root in what these people expressed while trying to book a flight. The final prototype is really made for them.
            Working on this project made me realise how much my skills from my previous career really aligned with those required in a UX project, from talking to and listening to people, to reflecting on gathered research, to 
            crafting that research into a design and utilising visual skills in honing the details of that design to assist the person interacting with it.
