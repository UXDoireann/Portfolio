                  <p>As part of a Professional Diploma in UX at the UX Design Institute, this project
                  involved designing a mobile flight-booking app for a fictitious airline.<br><br>
                  Designed to take out the confusion and regain confidence and trust in the flight-booking process
                  - from user research, to analysis, to design, prototyping and wireframing, I gained
                   experience of the full life cycle of a UX project.</p>

               <h5>Goal</h5>
               <p>I completed this project as part of my Professional Diploma in UX Design from the UX Design Institute (accreditated by Glasgow Caledonian University).<br><br>
                  The goal of the project was to create an end-to-end user flow for booking a flight on an airline native app.

               <h5>My Role</h5>
               <p>I completed the full process alone (except for a collaboration to analyize data with the affinity map). Skills demonstrated here include:

         <p>To understand how best-in-class mobile apps solve the problem of creating 
            a positive user experience of booking flights (or accommodation in the case of the indirect competitor, Airbnb), I compared and reviewed four apps:<br>
            <ol>
               <li>Turkish Airlines</li>
               <li>Alaska Air</li>
               <li>Easyjet</li>
               <li>Airbnb</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I focussed on three segments of the experience: <b>the landing page; flight/accommodation search; entering personal details.</b></p><br>

         <p>I created an online survey to get a better understanding of people's goals when booking flights online and to
            find out:
            <ul>
               <li>If the last time they booked a flight, did they use a mobile app or desktop website?</li>
               <li>Did they use an aggregator website as part of their search?</li>
               <li>What website or mobile app did they use to make their booking and why?</li>
               <li>Did this mobile app or website allow them to complete their booking easily?</li>
               <li>If not, why not?</li>

         <div class="right_text"> <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
         <p>I conducted three usability tests, each including an in-depth interview examining the user's habits
            and contexts surrounding their previous experiences of booking flights online. As FlyUX is a fictitious
            airline, I used two apps previously reviewed during Competitive Benchmarking: Turkish Airlines and Easyjet.<br><br>
            Listening to and observing these people search for and book flights was an incredibly interesting
            experience and provided a trove of insights and ideas. Throughout the overall design process, I kept
            these people in mind, thinking of their goals, their behaviours, their frustrations, their delight,
            their skepticism, their surprise and their stories.

            Focussing on the journey from searching for flights to payment, each screen, screen state and

            <p>A protoype isn't a prototype without a user to test it. Upon completing a medium-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD, I undertook a usability test, exploiting the opportunity to also conduct another indepth interview.
               Overall, the user found the prototype very easy to use, with a good general flow. I took note of some minor improvements that could be made during the 
               next iteration to further improve the flow. I was thinking little details eg. chevrons that animate to crosses when sections are opened and closed - which might sound trivial, but those visual cues really help people intuitively understand what's happening.
            Scroll a little further down to see the image below that shows a selection of screens from this medium fidelity prototype.</p>

         <div class="left_text"><h3>UI Design and Final Prototype</h3>
       <p>For the final prototype, I wanted to finish it with some beautiful UI for consistency, polish and aesthetic appeal. Following this, I conducted one more user test. This was really a sanity check to fully confirm everything was working as required, but also to test the visual style too.
          Everything was working as expected and the user found it easy to use. Small visual nudges using animations and images further enhanced the flow. Please see image of screens below or click on the link to try the prototype yourself.

         <p>Detailed wireframes were then prepared based on all the screens from the final prototype. 
            All interactions were accounted for on all screens from the landing page to payment.
            Having a knowledge of front-end development, I'm aware of what needs to be specificed here

         <p>Flight booking can be a anxiety inducing experience for many people. Being forthcoming with key information throughout the process is really
            important in gaining trust with the person using the app. Throughout the design process, I constantly thought back to the usability tests. 
            Design descisions all have their root in what these people expressed while trying to book a flight. The final prototype is really made for them.
            Working on this project made me realise how much my skills from my previous career really aligned with those required in a UX project, from talking to and listening to people, to reflecting on gathered research, to 
            crafting that research into a design and utilising visual skills in honing the details of that design to assist the person interacting with it.
