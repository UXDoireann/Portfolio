            involved designing a mobile flight-booking app for a fictitious airline.
            From user research, to analysis, to design, prototyping and wireframing, I gained
            experience of the full life cycle of a UX project.</div>

         <p>To understand how best-in-class mobile apps solve the problem of creating 
            a positive user experience of booking flights, I compared and reviewed four apps.
            I chose three well-regarded airline apps along with an accommodation booking app to see
            how a more indirect competitor designs for booking experiences.
            This proved to be an invaluable document that I referred back to on numerous occasions throughout
            the research, analysis and design phases.<br><br>

         <p>I created an online survey to get a better understanding of people's goals when booking flights online and to
            find out:
            <ul>
               <li>If the last time they booked a flight, did they use a mobile app or desktop website?</li>
               <li>Did they use an aggregator website as part of their search?</li>
               <li>What website or mobile app did they use to make their booking and why?</li>
               <li>Did this mobile app or website allow them to complete their booking easily?</li>
               <li>If not, why not?</li>

         <div class="right_text"> <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
         <p>I conducted three usability tests, each including an in-depth interview examining the user's habits
            and contexts surrounding their previous experiences of booking flights online. As FlyUX is a fictitious
            airline, I used two apps previously reviewed during Competitive Benchmarking: Turkish Airlines and Easyjet.<br><br>
            Listening to and observing these people search for and book flights was an incredibly interesting
            experience and provided a trove of insights and ideas. Throughout the overall design process, I kept
            these people in mind, thinking of their goals, their behaviours, their frustrations, their delight,
            their skepticism, their surprise and their stories.

         <p>Having collected a great deal of qualitative research, the next step was to use an affinity diagram to analyse the data in-depth. Sharing my research with another person, collaboratively, we wrote our observations on post-its. Following this a process of organising and re-organising the post-its ensued. As there was a lot to analyze, we got really granular in our final groupings of data. 
            While there is a lot to digest here, there were some key points that struck me....
         <ul id="key_points">
            <li>A general distrust and skepticism of 'extras' and luggage costs and hence a need for a constant <b>price clarity</b></li>
         <li>As this project took place during Covid-19 pandemic, when searching for flights, <b>lack of availability</b> was often an issue. How an app handled this (or didn't!) was a key noteworthy point</li>
         <li>Deviation from <b>established conventions</b> often caused confusion for users</li>
      <li>Important information should be <b>more forthcoming</b> eg. layovers</li></ul> </p></br></br>
